                        Here is what we do at Live Football Tickets:
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-[10px]">
                        We have created an online marketplace to make
                        hard-to-get tickets available to anyone providing
                        quality customer service. Ticket prices on our site are
                        determined by supply and demand (market value) by ticket
                        specialists (the sellers). Since supply and demand are
                        what drive the prices, today the prices can be low and
                        tomorrow they may be higher, it can always change.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-[10px]">
                        Fans need to place orders with LiveFootballTickets not
                        only because we have a friendly customer service,
                        leading security and a money back guarantee - they also
                        come to us since it is so difficult to get tickets from
                        the primary sources - especially for the biggest
                        matches. So this is why those hard-to-get tickets are
                        listed by the sellers above face value. Keep an eye out
                        for deals though - sellers also provide tickets below
                        face value when the market is full of tickets.

                        does not entitle you to cancel your order or grant you
                        any variances from our terms and conditions. Any attempt

                    <p className="mb-[10px]">
                        Refunds are only possible when an event is cancelled and
                        not postponed or rescheduled. Under the extraordinarily
                        rare circumstances in which an event is cancelled or
                        government restrictions on stadium capacities are
                        implemented, LiveFootballTickets.com will refund
                        everything except for the service fee (variable
                        processing & administrative expenses). A credit, in the
                        form of a voucher code, for the full value of the
                        service fee, will be provided to customers for
                        application towards future orders, valid for 2 years.
                        The value of the refund is for the price of tickets and
                        shipping only, as LiveFootballtickets.com has the right
                        to retain its booking fee to cover variable processing
                        and administrative expenses, under Consumer Law. If an
                        event has been cancelled and not rescheduled, you will
                        be contacted by our customer service to arrange your
                        refund.

                    <p className="mb-[10px]">
                        In the rare event a customer does not receive their
                        tickets in time for a match (for an event that is not
                        cancelled), a full refund will be issued to the buyer.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-[10px]">
                        If the customer would like to sell the tickets that they
                        purchased, they can contact us to do so. We will attempt
                        to sell the tickets for them on consignment - meaning
                        that if we can resell them - then they get their money
                        back - but if we can not we will return the tickets to
                        them.

                    <p className="mb-[10px]">
                        If the customer originally purchased those tickets from
                        our website and we are able to sell their tickets, our
                        fees for selling their tickets will be waived and they
                        will receive 100% of the amount that we sell them for,
                        up to the amount that they paid for them. Since
                        consignment tickets are their property, we need the
                        customer is direction on the price they want for their
                        tickets. Also, in case their tickets do not sell, they
                        must clearly tell us when they want the tickets returned
                        to them.
