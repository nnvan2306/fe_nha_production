            <h6 className="font-[700]">History</h6>

            <p className="text-[14px] mb-[10px]">
                At the end of the 1990-1991 season, people made a proposal to
                establish a new league. The idea behind this proposal was to
                bring more money into the game of football. The top-flight clubs
                signed the Founder Members Agreement on 17 July 1991. This was
                the start of the Premier League as we know it. This newly formed
                top division is commercial independent from the Football
                Association and the Football League. This gives the Premier
                League license to negotiate its own sponsorship agreements. With
                this independence the English teams were expected to be able to
                compete with the other European clubs. The Premier League
                started with a main sponsor, but in the second year they reached
                an agreement with Carling. Carling sponsored the Premier League
                between 1993 and 2001. In 2001 Barclayscard took over the
                sponsorship. Barclays (the company name after a rebranding)
                ended their sponsorship in 2016. The FA announced they will not
                be looking for a new sponsor. The goal is to build a clean brand
                in line with the major sports league in the United States.

                The battle for the top 4 is not the only exciting battle in the
                Premier League. The tension is probably even higher at the
                bottom of the table. The three teams with the least points at
                the end of every season get relegated to the Championship.
                Relegation is the biggest fear for every team in the Premier
                League. Although there are some teams which are highly unlikely
                to relegate, nobody is safe in this competition. It is without a
                doubt that this is the worst thing to happen for every team in
                the Premier League. Teams in fear of relegation can use all the
                support you can give them. So, watch the matches of your
                favourite team live at the stadium. You really will enjoy the

            <p className="text-[14px]">
                European top clubs announced the European Super League. A new
                league where 20 teams created their own tournament. A tournament
                without any form of relegation and promotion, where the teams
                are always safe to play in. The big six of the Premier League
                (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United
                and Tottenham Hotspur) all decided to join the Super League.
                Something that completely annoyed their fans, who all were
                together in their battle against the Super League. A response
                that the club owners never expected. After a fews days of heavy
                protest, the clubs decided to pull back and quit the Super
                League after all.
